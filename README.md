# Delphi Mocks

Delphi Mocks is a simple mocking framework for Delphi XE2 or later. It makes use of RTTI features that are only available in Delphi XE2, however I do hope to be able to get it working with earlier versions of Delphi (2010 or later) at some stage.

This framework currently only implements mocking for interfaces, mocking for objects will be added as time permits. 

Note : Expectations and Verification not yet implemented (working on it now)
